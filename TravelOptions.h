     *        - time is used as a tie-breaker for options with identical price.
     *
     *       For example, using the notation <price, time> to represent an option:
     *
     *             <5.1, 10.0>  must be before <5.6, 9.0>    (price is less, so time ignored)

     *       indistinguishible and must appear as a consecutive "block" if the list is
     *       to be considered sorted.

     *
     *   The option list below is sorted by our rules:

     *   The option list below is NOT sorted by our rules:
     *      [ <1, 7>, <2, 8>, <4, 3>, <3, 7>]
     *                                ^^^^^^ must be before <4,3>

     *   The option list below is also NOT sorted by our rules:
     *      [ <1, 7>, <2, 8>, <2, 5>, <3, 7>]
